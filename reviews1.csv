Quyen H.,5,2024-11-23,Hands down the best lamb tikka masala I've ever had!!! It was served with rice but we enjoyed dipping the butter parotta and roti very much... Loved their shakes (no preservatives) — mango lassi and chikoo were really delicious. Didn't like the saag paneer (personal preference). Service amazing; gorgeous restaurant with comfy booths. Will definitely come back.,Nawabi Hyderabad House,"St. Louis, MO",
Cat C.,4,2024-11-25,"Delicious food and large dining room with a second level. Very busy and short-staffed; dosa ETA moved from 40 to 60 minutes, so I switched to butter chicken. One dish never arrived; received a lassi as an apology. Plenty of parking; extensive menu; they still have kinks to work out.",Nawabi Hyderabad House,"Long Island, NY",
Das N.,3,2025-08-04,"Initially a solid 4.5–5, but recent visits slip to 3 due to high demand and limited staff causing mediocre service. Vegetarian highlights: veg kheema biryani, parotta with veg kheema curry, and Nawabi paneer biryani. Paneer starters are underwhelming with huge chunks. Quality varies with day; food sometimes not hot.",Nawabi Hyderabad House,"Saint Louis, MO",
Sneha S.,1,2025-07-26,"Used to be a regular for their biryani, but the new South Indian meals were a letdown. Rice, sambar, and rasam were cold; paneer was rubbery; poori felt like papad. Service was slow and inattentive; hygiene concerns with flies around the counter. Sadly, can’t recommend now.",Nawabi Hyderabad House,"London, United Kingdom",

Kenya D.,4,2024-11-01,Butter chicken was creamy without being heavy. Ask for medium spice for balance.,Nawabi Hyderabad House,"St. Louis, MO",
Omar A.,5,2025-06-04,Excellent vegetarian options—masala dosa was crisp and the chutneys tasted fresh.,Nawabi Hyderabad House,"St. Louis, MO",
Elena V.,4,2024-11-17,Portions are generous; split an entrée and add an appetizer to avoid leftovers.,Nawabi Hyderabad House,"St. Louis, MO",
